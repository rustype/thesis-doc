\begin{ntquote}

\foreigntextquote{english}[George Steiner]{%  --- translated from an interview with Expresso
  ... my motto was to know that the most powerful force is to be interested in something.
  (...) whatever it is, if you are interested enough to study and deepen it, then you are not in danger.
  If you stick to something -- it can be archeology, music, sports -- that is bigger than yourself,
  you are not in danger. The terrible thing is when people cling to nothing, to the void.
