        Attribute macros are commonly used in web frameworks to provide an easy way to declare an endpoint.
        In this example (taken from \autocite{Rocket2021}) the user declares that \texttt{GET} requests to \texttt{hello/}
        have two path parameters (\texttt{name} and \texttt{age}) and should be handled by the \texttt{hello} function.
