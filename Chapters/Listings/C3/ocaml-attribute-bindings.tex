        Example of the three kinds of attributes, taken from \autocite{Rebours2019}.
        The first line attaches to the \texttt{12} expression.
        The second attaches to the whole \texttt{let} binding (i.e \texttt{let b = "some string"}).
        Finally, the third line, does not attach to a particular member of the AST.
